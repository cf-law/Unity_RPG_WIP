# Unity_RPG_WIP

This is an in development top down, turn based RPG developed using the Unity engine. This is meant to be a testing ground as well as an exploration of the Unity engine for myself. This was done following various tutorials as well as helpful articles and guides online, and, as stated before, should be treated as a test of Unity as well as coding using C#, rather than an entirely original product coded from the ground up.

## Planned features:

* Small, enclosed map with moving units that can engage in combat with the player unit.
* Separate scene for turn based combat, which calculates unit health, mana, as well as turn order using unit speed.
* Combat includes different abilities that affect combat differently, such as spells and items, as well as out of turn effects like counter (which would trigger when attacked by an enemy unit on their turn).

## Currently implemented features:
* Main menu
* Movable player unit on the overworld map.
* Separate scene in turn based combat (WIP)
